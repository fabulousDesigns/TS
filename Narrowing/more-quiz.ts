 You have a union type of Shape = Circle | Square | Rectangle.
 How would you implement a function getArea(shape: Shape) that uses never for exhaustiveness checking?
 What would happen if you accidentally add a new shape like Triangle without updating getArea? How would TypeScript react? */

/**ðŸ”¥ Question 2: Discriminated Unions Deep Dive
Imagine you have a User type with the roles "admin" | "editor" | "viewer".
Each user has different fields: Admin has permissions, Editor has posts, and Viewer has readOnly.
Create a function describeUser(user: User) that returns a string summary of the user, and make sure you apply exhaustiveness checking with never.
What edge cases could break your logic, and how would you handle them?

/**ðŸ”¥ Question 3: Type Predicate Mastery
You are given a union type Fish | Bird.
Implement a user-defined type guard function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish.
Now, write a function describePet(pet: Fish | Bird) that uses isFish to provide different outputs depending on whether the pet is a Fish or Bird.
Explain why using the type guard pet is Fish works here. */

You have a union type ApiResponse = Loading | Success<T> | Error.
Write a function renderApiResponse(res: ApiResponse<string>) to render the state of the API.
How would you modify this function to handle multiple response types dynamically, like ApiResponse<number> or ApiResponse<MyCustomType>? What changes would you need to make to ensure the function is flexible and type-safe? */
